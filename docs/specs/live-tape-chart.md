# Feature Job Spec: Live Tape Chart

**Status:** Draft (Stage 4 — to-spec)
**Depends on:** Core: bookings engine (CRUD, state machine, availability), SSE hub, room inventory ledger
**Role specs:** `docs/role-specs/live-tape-chart/{receptionist,manager,housekeeping,maintenance}.md`
**Glossary:** `docs/CONTEXT.md` → Domain Terms → Tape Chart

## Problem

There is no visual overview of rooms × dates. Staff can't see which rooms are free, when, for how long — not in one place. The backend API already supports reservations, inventory, and availability queries, but there's no grid UI. Every major PMS (Cloudbeds, Mews, Opera) has a tape chart for a reason: it's the fastest way to understand and manipulate room inventory.

The tape chart must feel immediate: drag a block, it moves. A co-worker books a room across the lobby, the grid updates before your next blink.

## Solution

A real-time visual grid: **room rows × date columns** with draggable blocks. SvelteKit 5 frontend, Go/Chi backend, SSE for live sync. Four role-specific views sharing the same grid component, differing in overlay layer and interaction set.

### Grid component (shared)

- CSS Grid layout: one row per room, one column per day
- TanStack Virtual for horizontal + vertical virtualisation (100+ rooms × 365+ days)
- `@thisux/sveltednD` for drag-and-drop (create/move/resize)
- `@tanstack/hotkeys` for keyboard shortcuts
- SSE subscription for real-time block updates from other clients
- **Today column** highlighted, advances at property-local midnight

## Requirements by Role

### Receptionist (`Role: Reception`)

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| Room rows × date columns, scroll past & future | Phone guest, need to see availability quickly across date range |
| Reservation blocks = `reservation_item` rows, grouped by accent colour per parent reservation | Visual grouping of multi-room bookings; one item = one row |
| Create drag on empty cell → `status=hold` block → side panel for guest details → confirm | Speed: drag a room, fill details at leisure |
| Drag-and-snap: resize (shorten/lengthen), move (change room/dates) | Guest changes mind mid-call, adjust without starting over |
| Conflict detection: red highlight + tooltip during drag, server-enforced on save | Never double-book; visual feedback before server round-trip |
| Hover card on block: price, dates, guest name, status, code | Quick glance without opening panel |
| Click block → side panel: full details, per-night rates, guest info, folio summary | Deep info when needed |
| Right-click / keyboard shortcuts: check-in, check-out, cancel, view | Power user speed |
| Header bar: arrivals today / departures / stayovers / vacant (live via SSE) | "How's the day looking?" at a glance |
| Search bar (`/`) + room type filter strips | Find a specific booking or room quickly |
| Multi-room drag: drag selection over multiple rooms → batch hold creation | Family booking, company block |
| **NOT shown:** housekeeping status (dirty/clean/inspected) — that's Housekeeping view | The receptionist needs occupancy, not linen state |

### Manager (`Role: Manager`)

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| Same grid + occupancy heatmap (colour intensity = % occupancy) | Revenue pulse at a glance |
| Filter by room type, date range, occupancy % | Slice data to spot trends |
| Export/print current view | Morning meeting, reporting |
| Toggle rate overlay: show nightly rate in cells | Rate strategy, discount decisions |

### Housekeeping (`Role: Housekeeping`)

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| Same grid layout, cell status: `clean → dirty → in_progress → inspected` | Staff assignment, status tracking |
| Room-row colour driven by `housekeeping_status`, not occupancy | Cleanliness is the primary dimension |
| Click cell to cycle status | Quick update while walking corridor |
| Assignment view: assign housekeeper to a set of rooms for the day | Work distribution |
| Maintenance blocks shown as striped overlay | Avoid assigning a room mid-repair |

### Maintenance (`Role: Maintenance`)

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| Same grid layout | Shared visibility across roles |
| Create, move, resize maintenance blocks (striped, distinct from reservation blocks) | Schedule deep-clean, repair, inspection |
| Block types: `deep_clean | repair | inspection | out_of_service` | Categorise the work |
| **Maintenance blocks are exclusive** — no reservation can overlap | Someone should not be in a room during maintenance |
| Past blocks: read-only (log of completed work) | Record keeping |

## State Machine

**Reservation item status flow** (existing, already implemented):

```
hold ──→ confirmed ──→ checked_in ──→ checked_out ──→ archived
  │                                                        ↑
  └────── cancelled ←──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- `hold` → dashed/outline block. TTL-bound (`website_hold_ttl_seconds`, `internal_hold_ttl_seconds`).
- `confirmed` → solid block.
- `checked_in` → block locked (move triggers room-move flow §2.3, resize disabled for past nights).
- Drag on any status respects the state machine transitions.

**Maintenance blocks** — no state machine. `active` (in period) or inactive. Binary.

---

## Edge Cases

| Edge case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Hold expiry race** | Clerk holds a room, starts filling details. Before they confirm, SSE pushes an update — room now occupied. Grid: hold block shows conflict overlay. Save: server rejects. Clerk notified. |
| **Concurrent drag conflict** | Two clerks drag the same cell. First save wins. Losing client gets SSE update → block snaps into winning position with conflict animation. |
| **Drag-to-conflict** | Mid-drag over occupied cell → red highlight + tooltip "Occupied: [reservation code]". Drop in dead slot → snap-back to original. |
| **Checked-in item drag** | Moving a checked-in reservation block → triggers room-move flow (§2.3). DNM-level check applied. |
| **Partial drag** | Drag block edge left → shorten stay. Single operation on the item. No split. |
| **SSE reconnect (event replay)** | SSE events carry no sequential IDs. Client reconnects after network drop with stale grid. Add `id:` field to SSE events, client sends `Last-Event-Id` on reconnect for replay. |
| **SSE update during active drag** | SSE reconciliation suppresses for blocks currently being dragged — don't overwrite optimistic position under cursor. Resume on drag end. |
| **SSE merge** | Incoming block update (create, move, resize, delete, status change) → grid must reconcile against local array. If local has an unsaved hold block and SSE creates a confirmed block overlapping it → conflict overlay. |
| **Drag partial-conflict recovery** | Move operation spans N nights, but night 2 of the new range has a conflict → full revert. Atomic: all-or-nothing for any block move/resize. No partial moves. |
| **Grid scale** | 100+ rooms × 365+ days. Virtual scroll both axes. Only visible cells render. CSS `contain: layout paint` on cells. |

## Routes

### Pages (`/web/src/routes/`)

| Route | View | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Dashboard / overview | All |
| `/reservations/planner` | Reception tape chart (main view) | Reception |
| `/housekeeping/planner` | Housekeeping tape chart | Housekeeping |
| `/manager/planner` | Manager occupancy view | Manager |
| `/maintenance/planner` | Maintenance tape chart | Maintenance |

### API — New endpoints (maintenance only)

Reservation blocks use the existing reservation API (`/v1/reservations`, `/v1/reservations/items`). No new tape-chart-specific endpoints for reservations. Only maintenance needs new routes:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/tapechart/maintenance/blocks?from=DATE&to=DATE` | Fetch maintenance blocks for date range (grid merges with reservation items client-side) |
| `POST` | `/v1/tapechart/maintenance/blocks` | Create maintenance block |
| `PUT` | `/v1/tapechart/maintenance/blocks/{id}` | Update maintenance block |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/tapechart/maintenance/blocks/{id}` | Delete maintenance block |

**Reservation block operations via existing API:**

| Grid action | Existing endpoint |
|---|---|
| Fetch reservation blocks for date range | `GET /v1/reservations/items?from=DATE&to=DATE&include=shallow` |
| Create reservation (hold → confirm) | `POST /v1/reservations` |
| Move (change room/dates) | `PATCH /v1/reservations/items/{id}` |
| Resize (shorten/extend) | `PATCH /v1/reservations/items/{id}` |
| Check availability | Existing reservation availability endpoint |

**Enforced date-range max 90 days** on `GET /v1/reservations/items` with `include=shallow` — reject requests beyond the window.

### Existing relevant endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/reservations/items?from=DATE&to=DATE&include=shallow` | Reservation blocks for grid (shallow = no expanded reservation/guest) |
| `GET` | `/v1/reservations/{id}` | Full reservation detail (side panel) |
| `GET` | `/v1/reservations/items/{id}` | Single item detail (hover card) |
| `POST` | `/v1/reservations` | Create reservation (hold → confirm) |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/reservations/items/{id}` | Move or resize a block |
| `GET` | `/v1/sse` | SSE subscription (realtime grid updates) |

### Workers

| Worker | Purpose | Existing? |
|---|---|---|
| **Hold expiry sweeper** | Cancel `status=hold` reservations past TTL. Push SSE event on expiry → grid removes dashed block. | Yes (extend) |
| **Per-property timezone awareness** | Grid "today" column depends on property-local midnight. MVP: single timezone, read from `property.locale`. Multi-TZ deferred to future ADR. | New (config read) |
| **Inventory update broadcaster** | When any block changes (create/move/resize/status), push event to SSE hub. Grid subscribers reconcile. | New (thin wrapper over existing hub) |

### Migrations

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| `maintenance_blocks` table | Already exists (`migrations/00002_inventory_pricing.sql`) |
| `room_inventory_ledger` grid index | Already exists (`idx_inv_ledger_grid_view`) |
| Composite index `(property_id, room_type_id, calendar_date)` on `room_inventory_ledger` | New — required for tape chart date-range queries at scale |
| No other schema changes needed for MVP | ✅ |

## Architecture Notes

### Data flow

```
[Browser: SvelteKit grid]
        │ ▲
        │ │ Drag operations → optimistic UI
        │ │ SSE events → reconcile local state
        ▼ │
[Go API: /v1/tapechart/*]
        │
        ▼
[PostgreSQL: room_inventory_ledger + reservations + maintenance_blocks]
        │
        ▼
[SSE Hub: broadcast inventory changes]
        │
        ▼
[All connected browsers receive update]
```

### Drag → save protocol

1. **On drag start**: Quick availability check (`GET /v1/tapechart/availability`)
2. **On drag move**: Highlight conflict in real time (client-side, no server call)
3. **On drag end (drop)**: If no conflict → optimistic local update. `PUT /v1/tapechart/items/{id}/move|resize`
4. **Server validates**: state machine, availability, conflict check
5. **On success**: Server persists, SSE broadcast to all clients
6. **On failure**: Server returns 409 Conflict. Client reverts optimistic state, shows error toast
